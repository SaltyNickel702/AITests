# Number Recognition AI + Tests
I coded a simple neural network to perform my tests for my Research Question
This AI is a digit detection program, containing xx layers of nodes, in a 784 --> xx --> 10 layout
My tests will be about the accuracy different of normalization functions for nodes
### Dependencies
I used the MINGW64 terminal, which allowed me to install packages.
Packages I have installed
- OpenCL
	- ``pacman -S --needed \ mingw-w64-x86_64-opencl-headers \ mingw-w64-x86_64-opencl-clhpp \ mingw-w64-x86_64-opencl-icd``
- GLEW
	- ``pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glew``
- GLFW
	- ``pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-glfw``

Note: the pacman package manager may still need to be installed
